# Code-Vulnerability-Report-and-Analysis
This report showcases some of the vulnerabilities present in some of the examples given in the OWASP Top 10 guide.
 This report also has my take on some of the examples that it provides on Buffer Overflow attack.
 This also includes my personal analysis on some of the code and how I applied the lessons learned on input validations to help make the code more secure from reading up 
 on the documentation in the website as it is still relevant to this day.
 This also includes how I could exploit some of the codes' weakness to help further highlight the need on repairing the code's vulnerability
